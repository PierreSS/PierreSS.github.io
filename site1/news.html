		<h2>2013-02-14 - A Step Ahead: <span class="coloration">MT2</span> Launches the First and Only <strong class="coloration">XG-PON1 Analyzer and Emulator!</strong></h2>
			<p><span class="coloration">MT2</span>, the worldwide leader in GPON testing and monitoring solutions, is launching the XG-PON Platform, a FPGA based server which can work as either an <strong class="coloration">analyzer or an OLT emulator for XG-PON1 networks</strong>, with revamped and optimized versions of its analyzer and OLT emulator client GUI software.
				"Our X-G.PON1 solution builds on the strengths of our NIVA series: with its powerful client-server architecture, it is the only test tool which can analyze XG-PON1 bitstreams - in real-time and continuously. Of course, it is neutral and non-intrusive, the pure FPGA server (no specific chipset) is faster, more robust than ever, and the improved GUIs will offer to our customers a more comprehensive view of the network with a unique comfort," says Christian Sellier , MT2's CEO.
				In partnership with LAN, the official BBF.247 ONU conformance certification laboratory, <span class="coloration">MT2</span> has also updated its BBF.247 test-suite to support the new IR-247 issue 2 test-plan. <span class="coloration">MT2</span> is a proactive member of the Broadband Forum and is committed to the success of the certification program.
				Hervé Mary, LAN CEO said: "MT2's toolset was a key factor in the implementation of the BBF.247 certification program and we are glad to pursue our partnership with <span class="coloration">MT2</span> to offer an up-to-date, ever more accurate and comprehensive testing experience."
				This new OD-247 issue 2 test-suite is available immediately and will be included in upgrades for testbeds under guarantee or maintenance contract.
				MT2's NIVA analyzers offer in-depth, comprehensive analysis and a most comfortable user experience in the <strong class="coloration">ADSL, GPON and now XG-PON1 domains</strong>.
				<span class="coloration">MT2</span> GPON and XG-PONs eOLT scriptable OLT emulators are a unique testing tool for ONUs, offering great flexibility and native support for test automation.
				The <span class="coloration">MT2</span> BBF.247 testbed (NIVA Analyzer+eOLT+BBF.247 scripts) has been chosen by LAN, the official BBF.247 ONU conformance certification laboratory.</p>

		<h2>2012-05-15 - The GPON tool set of reference is keeping the pace!</h2>
			<p><span class="coloration">MT2</span> launches new versions of its GPON tools and BBF.247 Conformance Testbed.
				«The GPON tool set of reference is keeping the pace!»
				Tournon, France, May 2, 2012
				<span class="coloration">MT2</span>, a prominent provider of broadband testing and monitoring solutions (www.mt2.fr), is launching new versions of its GPON analyzer – NIVA-GPON – and OLT emulator – eOLT-GPON. These tools with their associated OISG (FSAN) approved test sequences are used by LAN, the official ONU certification laboratory for the BBF.247 program, and now by several important companies involved in the GPON domain.
				The <strong class="coloration">NIVA-GPON</strong> analyzer now features continuous real-time analysis support for GPON's full data-rate (2.5Gbits/s downstream, 1.2Gbits/s upstream), and ethernet payload replication up to 1Gbits/s.
				Key new features for the eOLT-GPON include:
				Improved automation functionalities.
				Remote GUI control through CLI.
				BBF.247 issue 2 sequences, based upon its current version, are implemented and available – they will be updated as the BBF.247 evolves.
				Both analizer and emulator also feature a new Optical power indicator for both continuous (downstream) and burst (upstream) modes, and an improved GUI.
				The BBF.247 <span class="coloration">MT2</span> tools (Analyzer + OLT emulator) generate and analyze PLOAM, OMCI, GEM and Ethernet messages in accordance with BBF.247 tests. The verdict is provided automatically according to the test-cases criteria. <span class="coloration">MT2</span> tools also present a feature, both complete and user-friendly, to create new tests at the physical (GTC level), PLOAM, OMCI or Ethernet layers.
				Complete automation, for any set of test-cases (BBF.247 or user made) is natively included, thus saving time in performing and verifying ONU conformance tests.
				<span class="coloration">MT2</span> is an active BroadBand Forum (BBF) member and is deeply involved in the BBF.247 program. The new versions are immediately available and will be included in upgrades for the tools already in service (chipset and ONU manufacturers, Telcos, ITLs, ...).</p>
